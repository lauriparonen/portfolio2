        In 2022, OpenAI published DALL-E 2, a now-deprecated image generation model that could create images from text prompts. 
        This was a very brief period of time when AI image generation wasn't <i>slop</i> yetâ€”each image seemed pregnant with 
        a promise of infinite possibility and creative freedom, and this potentiality fragranced each generation with a sense of aesthetic richness
        which compensated for the abundant visual inconsistencies and imperfections.

        Brian Eno noted that <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/649039-whatever-you-now-find-weird-ugly-uncomfortable-and-nasty-about"

         "whatever you now find weird, ugly, uncomfortable and nasty about a new medium will surely become its signature."</a> There
         is certainly no shortage of things to find ugly and nasty about AI image generation as a medium, and I am by no means a 
        proponent of "AI art"; however I chose to include these generations of mine on this site as a little token of <i>nostalgia</i>,
        to celebrate the transience of this specific model. I shall always have a soft spot in my memory for it.
